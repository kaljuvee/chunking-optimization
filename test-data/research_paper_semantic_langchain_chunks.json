We evaluate the effectiveness of semantic, content-aware, and hierarchical chunking strategies compared to traditional fixed-size approaches.\n        \n        Introduction\n        Information retrieval systems rely heavily on effective document segmentation. Traditional chunking methods use fixed-size windows, which often break semantic units and reduce retrieval effectiveness.",
